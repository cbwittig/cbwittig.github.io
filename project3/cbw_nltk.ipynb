       "<title>Introduction</title>\n",
       "<p>They call to us from newsstands and racks by grocery store checkouts, the bright colors on their covers competing with the candy displays; teen magazines are the literary sweet that satisfies the craving for normalcy. The covers of the latest teen magazines aimed at adolescent girls promise readers dates, beauty, and success, and feature celebrity role models smiling beneath the mastheads. The experience of reading the glossy booklets seems ultimately depressing; compared to the rich superstar singer, the skinniest model, even the glamorous writers, the reader would require an identity facelift to compete with these supposed peers. Yet teen magazines continue to flourish as, in the last five years, traditionally women’s magazines have released “little sister” editions of their titles, including the best‐selling <italic>CosmoGirl!</italic> In 2002, teen‐targeted magazines <italic>Seventeen</italic>, <italic>YM</italic>, and <italic>CosmoGirl!</italic> were among ABC’s top 100 circulating magazines, with average circulations of 2,445,539; 2,231,752; and 1,062,271, respectively (MPA Resources). Amid the arguments against these systematic, monthly self‐esteem deflators, readership grows. What needs are being fulfilled by these monthly publications, and what makes them such popular reading material?</p>\n",
       "<p>Magazines created for teenage girls are effective because of their developmental appropriateness; the relationship developed between magazine and reader represents a distinct feminine space, while the demands of the text itself are appropriate to the analytic ability of the adolescent. The inclusion of the confessional “embarrassing story” column that has become the mainstay of the teen magazine is a unique example of the sympathetic space created between reader and text by the magazines. The embarrassing stories content of these magazines is purposefully constructed not only to entertain but also to offer behavioral guidance; the editors of these columns rely on specific hypotheses regarding adolescent literacy and development to maintain this dual function. By examining theories of adolescent identity development and the implied effects of environment on self‐esteem building, we can investigate the influence of teen magazines and their “embarrassing stories” on adolescent girls and theorize—through the use of reader response—the full impact of these texts.</p>\n",
       "</sec>\n",
       "<sec id=\"sc2\">\n",
       "<title>Developmental Psychology and the Teen Magazine</title>\n",
       "<p>We may look to the discipline of developmental psychology to support our theory of the developmental appropriateness of teen magazines. Psychologist Erik Erikson examined the effects of the environment on child development and concluded that, in adolescence, identity development is relative to gender. Freudian psychology pronounced this presumption as well, linking identity and self‐concept to recognition of gender; however, Freud’s identity construction theory is centered on one symbol. To Freudian psychologists, identity is created on the basis of genitalia; one is the possessor of a phallus or one is not. On the contrary, Erikson theorizes that identity development begins with the recognition of one’s gender as unique and not necessarily relative to its opposite. Erikson has written: “It is never enough, then, to characterize the sexes by the way they differ from each other. … Rather, each sex is characterized by a uniqueness which includes (but is not summed up by) its difference from the other sex” [1, 82]. Thus, according to Erikson, identity begins in either sex with a positive construction, not a relative or negative association with a power figure.</p>\n",
       "<p>Erikson’s theory of the uniqueness of gendered experience was developed after his observation of children at play and, later, by an iteration of tests of play construction. As Erikson observed children playing with a prescribed set of constructing objects, he noticed a difference in the theme of constructs based on sex. “In evaluating a child’s play construction, I had to take into consideration the fact that girls and boys used space differently and that certain configurations occurred strikingly often in the constructions of one sex and rarely in those of the other,” noted Erikson [2, p. 270]. Under Erikson’s observation, boys had the tendency to build towers and tall buildings and then destroy these scenes in elaborate action sequences. Girls’ constructions, however, were of interiors and included elaborate attention to the detail of the entrance of these buildings. Each gender’s construction seemed categorically symbolic of sexual identity, though neither employed the same language of symbol. That is, instead of constructing an elaborate shrine to the phallus, as Freud may have expected, girls celebrated the womb. These observations led Erikson to believe that the recognition of sexual identity is not relative but singular.</p>\n",
       "<p>Although Erikson recognizes the female as unique and her experience as individuated, he approaches gendered societal roles with fatalism. “Woman in many ways, has kept her place within the typologies and cosmologies which men have had the exclusive opportunity to cultivate and to idolize,” writes Erikson [2, p. 262]. Indeed, though women can be blamed for their acceptance of the gendered status quo, Erikson does admit to a masculine influence in the preservation of the patriarchy: “No doubt there exists among men an honest sense of wishing to save … a sexual polarity … and an essential difference which they fear may be lost in too much sameness” [2, p. 264]. With these statements, Erikson implies a certain biologic determinism in the construction of sex or gender roles. This determinism is exemplified in the teen magazine itself: the magazine is a form of place‐holding within Erikson’s so‐called typologies and cosmologies. While many magazines aimed at teenage girls preach “girl power” and even a political agency of sorts, that the magazines’ notions of power are gendered confirms the preservation of Erikson’s “sexual polarity.” A static system is continually recreated as new generations of adolescents come of age and accept or absorb traditional ideas of their roles within a capitalist society.</p>\n",
       "<p>Where do magazines fit in this relationship of maintenance and revolution? Are teenage girls, like communist countries, in need of democratization? Are magazines for girls, mediated by capital and directed at females in a critical stage of development, a tool to maintain the patriarchy? Joy Leman, in a criticism of women’s magazines, writes of the monthlies as “media products” and deems them “part of an ideological apparatus presenting a view of the world which is at most points locked into the economics and political interests of the capitalist system” [3, p. 66]. Dawn Currie echoes this point in her study of teenage girls’ magazines: “Teenzine messages are a product of the relations among various economic interests that include editors, publishing houses, and advertising agencies and their clients” [4, p. 282]. Here, Currie identifies girls’ magazines and the messages within them as products of a greater (capitalist) mechanism. If we view capitalism as a masculine construction in which women cannot assert themselves, we may also recognize women’s magazines as an evil tool of this system. However, an alternative view can be constructed via Erikson’s theories of identity development. Women’s and girls' magazines celebrate the feminine inner space (emphasized in the girls’ constructions) and represent a forum, albeit limited by advertising, for issues of interest to females. Angela McRobbie’s recent work concerning women’s and adolescent girls’ magazines has included critical remarks regarding the discursive tradition that would focus on the detrimental (read “nonfeminist”) nature of these publications. McRobbie writes: “There remains an important relation between feminism and the world of girls’ and women’s magazines; the new intersections between them need to be examined in depth” [5, p. 47].</p>\n",
       "<p>Both Erikson and fellow developmentalist Jean Piaget recognize the power of the peer group to influence identity development, and the teen magazine as a guide is a peer group itself. Piaget claims that the identification with a microcosm of society allows an individual to feel anchored in the world. “The adolescent,” claims Piaget, “views its own plans and activities as they relate to an idealized social group. The individual [thus] begins to think of itself as a full‐fledged member of society” [6, p. 96]. The teen magazine, with its images of corporeal perfection and promises of social success, can be seen as evidence of a social ideal to which developing teens may aspire. Self‐development is referential and in varying ways influenced by an individual’s alignment with a social group. Such identification may lead an adolescent to form a mirror group, or clique, of her own. According to Erikson, the “discomfort” of adolescence (“when genital puberty floods body and imagination with all manner of impulses”) is assuaged by “forming cliques and stereotyping themselves” [2, p. 133]. Elizabeth Heilman, echoing Erikson in 1998, claims that the dominant class structure “is additionally reinforced through the self‐determined groupings of adolescents from different social class backgrounds” [7, p. 6]. The media are a direct source for images of social groupings, as teens seek refuge in a socially safe category; teen magazines in particular offer monthly images of social promise.</p>\n",

       "<sec id=\"sc3\">\n",
       "<title>The Language Lure and the Developmentally Appropriate Voice</title>\n",
       "<p>The use of language, particularly the cultivation of an inclusive narrative voice, is a primary method employed by women’s and girls’ magazines to create a feminine space. Many girls’ magazines begin with a letter from the editor, the intimate tone of which, writes Leman, “attempts to establish some kind of ‘sisterly’ relationship between magazine and reader” [3, p. 66]. <italic>YM</italic>’s monthly letter from the editor is wrapped around candid snapshots of the editor herself, the magazine staff, and sometimes celebrities. <italic>Teen</italic> magazine’s editorial letter is much less folksy and signed by “the Teen Crew,” while <italic>CosmoGirl!</italic> usually features a close‐up of editor Atoosa Rubenstein and invitations to contact her directly (via E‐mail). According to Erikson, adolescent attachment to these glamorous, sisterly role models is not uncommon. In fact, the relationship encouraged between magazine and reader is developmentally significant. As adolescents look to their surroundings to mediate identity construction, their “willingness to put [their] trust in those peers and leading, or misleading, elders who will give imaginative, if not illusory, scope to [their] aspirations is only too obvious” [2, p. 129]. As teen magazines are peppered with images of physical perfection (or society’s definition thereof), it would seem as if the first communication from this source, the editor’s letter, would foster a reader’s aspirations and serve to shape them through the magazine’s contents.</p>\n",
       "<p>The editor’s letter itself and the attention and importance given to this first and inviting communication mirrors a phenomenon observed by Erikson. The elaboration of the entrances to girls’ play constructions symbolizes both the importance of the vagina as gateway and the symbolic importance of any entry to intimacy. The pseudopersonal note from the editor to the readers of the teen magazine is an embodiment to this attention to detail. The intimate, knowledgeable tone taken by the editor in the introduction is a careful seduction and celebration of the magazine’s interior. This gentle welcome within the first pages of the teen magazine is clearly significant, both developmentally and symbolically.</p>\n",
       "<p>This introductory letter from the editor serves both to mask the adult/establishment influence on the magazines’ publication and to encourage young readers’ ownership of the text. Margaret Finders, in <italic>Just Girls: Hidden Literacies and Life in Junior High,</italic> has observed the effects of this construction: “While … adults produce these [teen] magazines, the girls perceived zines as exclusively their own. … [They] never acknowledged any adult presence behind the youthful images” [8, p. 57]. Although the teen magazines’ editors may indeed be adults, the portraits that accompany their editors’ letters are, in Finders’s words, “youthful.” <italic>CosmoGirl!</italic>’s Atoosa Rubenstein’s recent photograph depicts the twenty‐something editor in a tight, sleeveless T‐shirt, with glowing skin and a confident smile; Rubenstein looks like the fantasy older sister. Moreover, Rubenstein’s invitation to write to her “24/7” at her E‐mail address increases this perception of intimacy. <italic>YM</italic>’s opening statement from editor Christina Kelly is presented in a handwritten font, looks like a note that might be passed during a boring class, and features a snapshot of Kelly clipped to the text. Finders continues: “by concealing any adult presence, teen zines were embraced by early adolescent females as their own” [8, p. 59]. The image of the teen magazine as a guiding publication edited by hip young women is cultivated in the editor’s letter; the (presumably) suit‐wearing, middle‐aged business people who financially support the magazines’ production and the advertising executives who influence the magazines’ content are distinctly absent personalities from the literal text.</p>\n",
       "<p>The content of many monthly girls’ magazines may represent to the teen reader the parameters of available identity. In a 1991 published study of the content of teen magazines, Evans and associates examined patterns of content in three of the then most widely circulated teen magazines: <italic>Sassy</italic>, <italic>YM</italic>, and <italic>Seventeen</italic>. Evans and associates found a prevalent double message embedded in the contents of the observed magazines: “Although ostensibly governed by the theme of self‐improvement, these publications seem to approach the topic largely through fashion dressing and physical beautification” [9, p. 110]. While fashion and beauty care dominated the magazines in Evans’s study, the results note, “Articles about interpersonal relations constituted the most frequent category of identity themes … [and included] articles about dating and heterosexuality … followed by general peer relations … and family issues” [9, p. 105]. Erikson student and psychologist Carol Gilligan would find the magazines’ emphasis on interpersonal relationships developmentally apt, as she postulates that adolescence is the period during which girls begin to navigate more complex relationships with peers. Gilligan writes: “As girls on the edge of adolescence gain cognitive and emotional capacities to know the relational world in new ways … they begin to grasp the realities of relationships and of women’s lives in new ways” [10, p. 160].</p>\n",
       "<p>Enter the teen magazine, with its plethora of advice columns from various experts and monthly quizzes to gauge normalcy. By addressing the issues at the forefront of adolescent concerns, teen magazines build a near impenetrable front of influence in the lives of adolescent girls. In addition, the teen magazine encourages a metarelationship—a relationship with itself. Finders again cites the “invisibility of adults” as an explanation of this relationship: “The invisibility of adults and the strong sense of sameness may have fostered a sense of seamless connection between their friends and experiences and those in the zines. … Lacking a critical distance that fiction creates, zines were received as truths” [8, p. 62]. Through the personalization of the messages within (the invitational editor’s letter, the participatory quizzes, the publication of reader letters and concerns), teen magazines seek to foster a relationship between the girl and the publication.</p>\n",
       "<p>Teen magazines offer illusory personalized messages to readers via the interactive components of the magazine, including—but not limited to—the letters to the editors, advice columns, embarrassing story submissions, and quizzes. This illusion of personalization and even agency, not always found in young adult novels, may be what makes adolescent magazines an important and even necessary part of a library collection. Among the conclusions Currie documents in her study, the analysis of these interactive components of the magazines is of particular interest. Currie exposes the illusion of agency such columns promise, writing, “As in advice columns, [in quizzes] … the text offers the seeming pleasure of ‘writing’ Self; if the reader is to be rated a ‘successful’—hence ‘normal’—person, this writing must fall within the narrow confines of the values promoted elsewhere in the magazine” [4, 206]. Currie argues that this kind of negotiation—between the subject and the text—produces a “subjectivity constantly engaged in self‐regulation and normalization” [4, p. 207] to the ends prescribed by the magazine itself. Catherine Driscoll assumes a similar stance in her ethnography of adolescent girls in Western popular culture, writing, “girls’ magazines foreground both self‐surveillance and self‐production, most explicitly in the problem pages and other scenarios of guidance” [11, p. 75].</p>\n",
       "<p>Ultimately, Currie concludes that the lived experiences of adolescent girls are not radically different enough from the prescriptions the magazines suggest to encourage individual formation of alternative modes of subjectivity. Citing the “normalizing” power of school culture, Currie writes that girls’ experiences in school reinforce or are reinforced by magazine images of femininity. “While girls recognize that magazine standards of feminine beauty are unrealistic, experience tells them that the cultural mandate to be beautiful conveyed by these texts is real,” claims Currie [4, p. 245]. “In conclusion,” Currie writes, “the power of the text lies in its demonstrated ability not only to construct a reading Subject who accepts dominant definitions of being a woman, but also to normalize the dominant order as it is experienced through school culture” [4, p. 245]. Magazines seek to document and reproduce the social world of adolescents; this textual mirror may offer a truthful enough representation of teen life that the “improving” suggestions of the publication become normalized and not extreme. That is, the lived experiences of teenage girls are not directly informed via literal translations of magazine texts. However, the extra‐normalizing power of these “teenzines” is a real consequence of their reading.</p>\n",
       "<p>The relationship created between reader and magazine is fostered through text; the naturalness with which the words can be read and the articles’ arguments understood pacifies the reader and may allow her to drift more willingly into the space created between publication and reader. By understanding the cognitive development of adolescents, magazine publishers and writers can take advantage of the appropriateness of certain texts and vocabularies. According to Piaget, early adolescents at the formal operational level are just beginning to “apply operations not only to objects, but to hypotheses, formulated in words” [6, p. 26]. The teen magazine as developmental guide is rife with hypothetical identities; under the guidance of the editors, a reader may contemplate, presumably through manipulation of fashion and makeup, for example, a number of personalities. The illustrations of these potential selves are constructed and made more effective by utilizing specific and timely terminology. For example, while a teen magazine like <italic>YM</italic> or <italic>CosmoGirl!</italic> may not employ the most sophisticated vocabulary or metaphor, the use of teen‐specific slang makes the text nearly incomprehensible to those readers outside the influence of teen culture.</p>\n",
       "</sec>\n",
       "<sec id=\"sc4\">\n",
       "<title>Embarrassing Stories and Undercover Socialization</title>\n",
       "<p>The inclusion of reader‐written, embarrassing anecdotes has heightened the popularity of many teen magazines; the developmental appropriateness of this magazine mainstay, in which social guidance is offered in the guise of commiseration, should be of particular notice. The texts of these columns, titled, “Say Anything” in <italic>YM</italic>, “Trauma Rama” in <italic>Seventeen</italic>, and “Why Me?” in <italic>Teen</italic>, consist of a collection of embarrassing incidents in the magazine readers’ lives. Readers are encouraged to write to the magazine’s editors with their own tales, which, if published, will garner ratings on an editorial scale. <italic>YM</italic> rates its readers’ tales with a system of stars: a single‐star rating translates to a sympathetic “Glad It Didn’t Happen to Me”; a four‐star humiliation offers the advice “Better Switch School Districts.” <italic>Teen</italic> magazine utilizes a rating system based on flames; one‐flame stories are considered less embarrassing than stories rated with four flames. <italic>Seventeen</italic> uses a three‐tiered rating scale and offers a sarcastic one or two sentence commentary on each anecdote. Although the submitted tales are supposedly the work of magazine readers, the jargon and tone of the stories themselves belie either a strict reader adherence to the slang and writing style of the magazine or heavy editing. The anecdotes may reference certain popular teen styles (by designer name) or use teen‐specific shorthand (like “b.f.” for “best friend” or “b.f.f.” for “best female friend”) to create a tone of inclusion.</p>\n",
       "<p>As with the editor’s letter, the embarrassing stories column utilizes developmentally appropriate text and mimics an interaction between the reader and the publication to encourage readership. The encouragement of submissions, as well as the rating of those published writings, suggests a real communication between magazine reader and magazine staff. The ratings or comments issued by the magazine staff imply an interactive empathy and personal interaction not unlike that created in the editor’s letter. Occasional inclusion of celebrity shame and staff humiliations serves to widen the empathetic discursive community created in this column.</p>\n",
       "<p>That the experience of shared humiliation is used in this context to encourage readership may seem to be exemplary of the final exit of good taste within publishing. Christopher Lasch writes in a 1992 <italic>New Republic</italic> article concerning shame and the creation of a seemingly uncensored media: “Is there anything our culture still attempts to conceal? … Nothing can shock us anymore, least of all intimate revelations about personal life. The mass media do not hesitate to parade the most outlandish perversions, the most degraded appetites” [12, p. 2]. When reading of a fellow teen’s traumatic experience involving a leaking maxi‐pad and a light‐colored dress or the humiliation involved in passing loud gas during a silent chemistry test, it does seem as if no barriers exist between the personal and the publishable. However, these texts included in teen magazines and written in a manufactured “teen voice” are not only developmentally appropriate but also socially instructive.</p>\n",
       "<p>In an overview of the psychological studies related to the emotion of shame, Thomas J. Scheff cites 1978 Elias’s treatment of shame as the most inclusive. According to Scheff, “Elias shows that many of the principal sources of shame in modern societies [are] the body functions, one’s appearance, and one’s emotions” (p. 3) and that these sources of shame are relatively new. “Elias shows how shame was being used to socialize feelings about sexuality, etiquette and emotion [by the nineteenth century]” [13, p. 3]. These sources of humiliation still make up the landscape of embarrassment described in the teen texts. When examining the experiences catalogued in teen tales of embarrassment, these circumstances are very often mined for humiliating content.</p>\n",
       "</sec>\n",
       "<sec id=\"sc5\">\n",
       "<title>Embarrassing Incidents</title>\n",
       "<p>In an analysis of six months of embarrassing stories content published in 2002 in three leading teen magazines—<italic>Teen</italic>, <italic>Seventeen</italic>, and <italic>YM</italic> (all of which were located in a noncirculating collection in my local library)—a number of thematic consistencies became visible. Within each collection, scenarios related to teen social encounters, rule breaking, and physical control showcased teen‐ (and often, gender‐) specific landscapes as potential etiquette minefields. The subjects of these stories were coded with the following thematic titles: “Showing Too Much Interest in a Boy,” “Amorous Errors,” “Accidental Nudity” (partial or complete), “Underwear” (mention of or view, unworn), “Menstrual Period” (including the surprise onset of a menstrual period or the view, by others, of any feminine hygiene product), “Beauty Blunders” (clothes, hair, or makeup mistakes noticed by and remarked upon by others), “Showing Off” (accidents that occur when the narrator is vying for attention), “Clumsiness,” “Stood Up by Date,” “Bathroom/Excrement Related,” “Caught Making Out,” “Caught Breaking Rules” (including school rules or household rules), “General Etiquette,” and “Other” (various errors). While some of the incidents described in the texts illustrate deviance from generally socially understood mores (“General Etiquette,” “Caught Breaking Rules”), the chronicling of the other less universally understood scenarios serve to, as Scheff writes, “socialize feeling about sexuality, etiquette, and emotion” specific to the behavior of adolescent girls. Clearly, teenaged girls caught “out of control” (making out with a partner, showing off to attract attention, applying makeup with a heavy or an uneducated hand) risk embarrassment and social alienation. The teenaged reader, made aware of the risks of certain behaviors in certain scenarios can, by studying these columns, develop a literal vocabulary of humiliation while absorbing subtextual societal rules.</p>\n",
       "<p>The data included in the figures attached to this research are indicative of an initial and individual reading of the collected embarrassing stories. Verification of these findings occurred later and involved the rereading of the texts by the primary investigator and the reading and evaluation of the texts by a secondary reader. In the reading process, each reader was asked to code the embarrassing stories in terms of their “aboutness” and based on a list of subject headings created for this purpose. The “aboutness,” or the subject of each anecdote, was to be considered the “thing afforded matter or action of a specified kind; a ground, motive, or cause” (from the <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic>'s definition of “subject”). That is, though the general theme of all the narratives was “embarrassment” or “embarrassing stories,” the subject selections reference the potential causes of the humiliations described.</p>\n",
       "</sec>\n",
       "<sec id=\"sc6\">\n",
       "<title>Content Analysis Statistics (Using Cohen’s Kappa)</title>\n",
       "<p>By tabulating the occurrences of agreement among readers of “aboutness,” a measure of Cohen’s kappa, used as an index of interrater reliability, was computed. The initial measurement of kappa was insignificant where satisfactory reliability is said to occur with a measurement of 0.70; the findings here were only reliable at 0.662. Further examination of the data showed that the significance‐affecting disagreement between readers regarded distinguishing the differences between embarrassing events occurring as a result of general clumsiness or as a result of accidents occurring while the narrator was “showing off.” A hypothetical merging of this data into a single category increased the measurement of kappa past the significant mark. The lack of terminological clarity that seemed to have negatively affected the reliability measurement may be considered a methodological error; stricter adherence to the codes of scientific content analysis in an iteration of this examination may allow for more reliable and conclusive statistical data. Additional numeric inconclusiveness may have been a result of the gender of the readers. A comparison of the subject assignments of a body of male readers and a body of female readers may address the issue of the gendered nature of the texts and the meaning making implications of such a finding.</p>\n",
       "<p>Within the narratives, certain phrases were used with frequency to emphasize the dire nature of the embarrassing situation and to heighten the humiliation stakes. According to these anecdotes, often the embarrassing act is a secondary source of unease; the audience of the act can determine the level of shame conveyed in the text. Any embarrassment witnessed by “the entire school” or “entire grade”; performed before the most popular boy, girl, or clique; or meant to impress the best‐looking or “hottest” teacher or boy was almost certain to rate higher on the humiliation scale than lower‐stakes scenarios. In these anecdotes, embarrassment was not necessarily self‐determined; the level of shame was a product of the status of the watchers. This observation is notable both on a discursive and societal level. The drama of the setup for the embarrassing story is heightened by the description of the high‐stakes audience involved. That the narrator’s social standing may be in the balance makes the experience of reading the tale all the more delicious. Additionally, a reader may absorb the implication that she, as a female, as a character secondary to the popular clique or the best‐looking boy, will consistently occupy the object position in both the real‐life tale and in her own life. The internalization of the concept of the self as secondary, of womanhood as a performance, may be a by‐product of these intentionally sympathetic stories.</p>\n",
       "<p>The embarrassing stories content in teen magazines utilize a specific vocabulary of foreshadowing; frequent readers of these columns may become adept at interpreting the magazines' unique code of prescience. Louise Rosenblatt writes that a reader brings her own experiences to a text and that these experiences shape the reading of a work for an individual. These experiences may include knowledge of another language, situational experiences similar to the conflicts portrayed in the literature, or exposure to specific cultural symbols and mores. Rosenblatt writes that the words on the page encourage the reader to “draw on his past experiences with what the words point to in life and literature. The text presents these words in a new and unique pattern. Out of these he is enabled actually to mold a new experience, the literary work” [14, p. 30]. In the case of adolescent magazines’ embarrassing stories, a specific language of prediction is honed as readers accumulate “experiences” with a text.</p>\n",
       "<p>The acquisition of an embarrassing stories vocabulary becomes part of what Rosenblatt would deem a literary “experience”; the reader’s fluency in this vocabulary will inform her reading of the stories themselves. For example, often in the tales of “Menstrual Mistakes,” the mention of a white dress worn by the protagonist hints at a forthcoming menstrual disaster. That a ruined white (or light‐colored dress or outfit) becomes code for the ultimate menstrual mistake is of special note; the evidence of womanhood itself, as displayed in a clothing stain, is an ironic and distinctly gender‐specific source of embarrassment to portray in a teenage girls’ magazine. That the merest hint of a girl’s menstrual period is the source of embarrassment is evidenced in the tales involving the accidental sighting of wrapped tampons or the purchase of feminine hygiene items. Additional harbingers of doom include the mention of special attention paid to appearance—hair, clothes, and makeup—in anticipation of a particular (often romantic) encounter; these “best laid plans” can fail when a newly laundered outfit attracts a pair of “staticy” underpants, a trendy pair of jeans gets wet and bleeds dye on the wearer, or a tight pair of pants splits as the wearer bends over to attract a male.</p>\n",
       "<p>The cultivation of a specific vocabulary of suspense and foreshadowing that is granted meaning from the context in which it is situated is a phenomenon present here and described in reader‐response theory. Following Rosenblatt, we can hypothesize that the readers’ past experiences with reading similarly themed tales allow her to predict the scenario of humiliation explicated in each embarrassing text. This predictability grants a certain power to the experienced reader that is unavailable to the stories’ narrators; while the narrator of an embarrassing story fails to anticipate the humiliation to come, the reader—fluent in the language of the text—has likely foreseen the embarrassment described later. This foresight is a predictive gift cultivated by the reader as she reads, one that bestows on her a certain prescient textual power. The real‐life application of this reading is less agential; with the literal narrative absent in her living world, the teen reader learns to edit her own movements in anticipation and avoidance of the outcomes described in the embarrassing stories.</p>\n",
       "<p>Although the embarrassing stories can be categorized by subject or anecdote (see table 1), a less granular approach to analysis reveals three primary themes discussed throughout the columns: Behavior with Boys, Body Function, and Intimate Exposure. “Behavior with Boys” is discussed and analyzed at length in these columns; heterosexual relations are characterized as fraught with potential hazards. Embarrassing anecdotes of “Amorous Errors” include, in an issue of <italic>Seventeen</italic>, a tale of a welded‐together pair whose braces and lip jewelry linked together nearly inextricably. Getting caught in a clinch (by parents, brothers and sisters, or teachers) is the source of much humiliation, as is showing too much interest in a member of the opposite sex. Stories dealing with the functions of the body centered mainly around menstrual period disasters, with <italic>YM</italic> devoting an entire month’s column to menstrual stories. Stories falling under the “Intimate Exposure” category include both accidental nudity and the exposure of or mention of a narrator’s underwear. The mere mention of or glimpse of the underwear proved embarrassing, even if the underwear was unworn, that is, viewed in a drawer or backpack. These three general categories can be easily mapped onto Elias’s (per Scheff) primary sources of shame: “the body functions” (mapped to “Body Functions”), one’s appearance (mapped to “Intimate Exposure”), and one’s emotions (mapped to “Amorous Errors”). While Scheff and Elias may argue that their thematic categories are universal, as the categories are recalled in the pages of adolescent girls’ magazines, their treatment becomes distinctly gendered.

       "<p>Approximately half of the scenarios described in <italic>YM</italic> and <italic>Seventeen</italic> involved some kind of social or corporeal control. The reader learning from (and laughing with) these texts may absorb the socializing shorthand present beneath the text. If feminine success is measured by the avoidance of humiliations as great as those published, the social lessons taught in the magazines’ columns involve decreasing participation in events that could lead to the outcomes depicted. A certain social paranoia may emerge in the reader who absorbs the identity of the watchful woman who must be ever vigilant, guarding her intimate apparel from view, avoiding revealing clothing, and maintaining the secrecy surrounding menstruation or any bodily function. Luise Eichenbaum and Susie Orbach identified these ideas of self‐denial and feminine presentation in their 1982 book <italic>Understanding Women: A Feminist Psychoanalytic Approach</italic>. According to Eichenbaum and Orbach, the exhibition of the edited self is learned in childhood observation: “The little girl absorbs the idea that to get love and approval she must show a particular side of herself. She must hide her emotional cravings, her disappointments, and her angers. … She must hide her self. She comes to feel that there must be something wrong with who she really is, which, in turn, must mean there is something wrong with what she needs and what she wants” [15, p. 49].</p>\n",
       "<p>The teen magazine may further this concept with its embarrassing stories; based on their exploitation of social “don’ts,” the female reader may learn to associate some of her natural inclinations (menstruation, sexuality) with inappropriateness. The irreverent and genuinely humorous content of these columns of embarrassing stories attracts readers, while the use of developmentally appropriate language and topical subject matter furthers an agenda of social control.</p>\n",
       "<p>The eventual outcome of the internalization of these rules may already have been predicted by Eichenbaum and Orbach: “Slowly [the girl] develops an acceptable self, one that appears self‐sufficient and capable and will receive more consistent acceptance” [15, p. 49]. Taylor L., a teen writing of a regifting humiliation for <italic>Teen</italic>’s embarrassing stories page, illustrates the discomfort resulting from the false fronting: “I pretended to laugh [with the other students laughing at me], but deep down, I felt like barfing.”</p>\n",

       "<title>Developing Identities, Developing Text</title>\n",
       "<p>Although teen magazines may be seen as gross influences on girls’ identity development, it is important to theorize the effects of the discourse and to examine how readers of these magazines navigate the text. Reader‐response theorist Arthur Applebee links readers’ responses to text to development, mainly following Piaget’s theorized stages of development. During adolescence the “resources of formal operations have a dramatic effect on the child’s response” to literature, theorizes Applebee [16, p. 125]. As readers mature, their ability to relate to and draw conclusions from a text increases in scope and complexity. Applebee claims that, as readers enter the initial stages of formal operations, their ability to analyze a text in terms of their own experiences is developed. This one‐to‐one relationship between reader, experience, and text is complicated as the reader reaches the later stage of formal operations and begins to see the text as “one of many statements of how life might be understood, rather than simply a presentation of life as it is” [16, p. 125]. The initial period of text relation begins around age 12 or 13—coincidentally in the continuum of most teen magazines’ target markets—and grows in analytic complexity around age 16. Here, we may see the window of time marked by personal relation to text—Piaget’s initial stage of formal operations and Applebee’s early stage of analytic ability—a unique period of vulnerability to developmental influence through text.</p>\n",
       "<p>Developmentalists, psychologists, and even reader‐response theorists characterize the period of adolescence as a period of shifting paradigms. Erikson writes of the painful self‐awareness of the teen years and the struggle to attach to a frame of reference outside the self on which to build identity. Piaget associates adolescence with the increasing ability to perform complex tasks, while Applebee applies this cognitive growth to literacy and the experience of reading. Teen magazines, constructed with this convoluted time of physical and cognitive development in mind, do answer the needs of adolescent readers. By providing a framework for identity growth, supplying images of societal perfection, and taking advantage of the one‐to‐one relationship that can be forged between reader and text, magazines for teenagers, as well as those for adults, effectively guide identity development. The narrowness of this identity framework, as well as the normalcy promised if the guidelines described in the magazines are followed, is a source of critique identified by Driscoll: “Through a cult of normality and an eroticisation of the adolescent woman’s concern with normalizing her body, the feminine adolescent body is constructed in girls’ magazines as a range of desires trespassed upon by a variety of physiological imperfections” [11, p. 94]. Clearly, Driscoll and others acknowledge the successfulness of these publications in defining the parameters of identity and encouraging the marketing of these identities to teenaged readers. The effectiveness of these magazines to shape the identities of readers is rarely called into question; on the contrary, it is the shape of the identities the publications advocate that is more often argued.</p>\n",
       "<p>After reading earnest letters from the editors of teen magazines to the thousands of readers who purchase the publication each month, it becomes difficult to situate the friendly and helpful intent of the magazine staff within a greater context of capitalism and accusations of exploitation. Joy Leman reminds us that the “incantations of false intimacy are foregrounded—a discourse of friendliness, reassuring and relocating women in an idea of oppression and a position of exploitation,” are present in every issue [3, p. 65]. Indeed, according to Leman, the developmental needs of girls can be manipulated to serve the status quo and to maintain the profit motivations that sustain girls’ monthlies. In a power relationship mirroring capitalism, the teen magazine creates its own audience and thus its own sustenance. As ideals are marketed and branded within the glossy pages, advertisers pay to incorporate themselves within the identity for sale. According to Ross Ballaster and colleagues, the use of a “feminine” discourse, the manipulation and creation of gendered needs answered by advertised products, and the construction of the female reader as consumer is intrinsic to the survival of the magazines and the market that supports them. “Defining women as ‘not men’ … is evidently not a sufficient one for the women’s magazine,” reports Ballaster in a 1996 analysis of women’s publications. “If women are to buy and to be, they cannot be defined solely in the negative; femininity has to be given a particular content” [17, p. 91]. Here, femininity is advertised as a shifting product, an identity dependent on the consumption of goods or the application of products. More important, this advertising is displayed in a uniquely feminine space (Erikson) where, as Ballaster writes, women are more than just “not men.”</p>\n",
       "<p>Because of the developmental appropriateness of teen magazines, their influence on identity development has the potential to be great. However, opponents of the magazine argue that the identities illustrated between the pages—girlfriend, model, student, woman, sexual being—are often considered insignificant, weak, or even degrading. This weakness is an illusion founded on a history marked by the limited documentation of the participation of women in so‐called relevant historical activity. The identity historically accepted by women—including “the feminine virtues of passive goodness, personal service to others, and devotion to the domestic sphere” [17, p. 91]—has been limited not just by a conspiracy of patriarchy but by every woman who blindly accepts the supposed weakness associated with this identity. By escaping the idea of the female as not‐male and associating femaleness with “pleasure and attractiveness” [1, p. 95], as young girls did in an iteration of Erikson’s study, a uniquely feminine power may be cultivated. Furthermore, perhaps the perception of weakness or insignificant success lies in the frame we draw around women’s accomplishments and identities. The female space women create and celebrate is markedly different from the male power symbol and cannot be evaluated in the same way. Recognizing the strength in both models of power and identity may be the first step toward a goal of parity and a loosening of societal restraints binding women’s identities.</p>\n",
       "<p>While some teen magazines may be dismissed as “fluff” by teachers and librarians, researchers examining the practice of literacy remark on the agency associated with reading popular texts. Meredith Cherland, in an examination of girls’ reading practices in a Canadian elementary and junior high school, encourages us to view the popular reading of teenage girls outside of school assignments as recursive. Cherland, drawing from Giroux, writes that girls’ popular reading goes against the “hidden curriculum” present in many schools that would equate “the male experience … with human experience. … Literature [assigned in the school Cherland observed] … served, on the one hand, to validate only man’s experience of the world and, on the other hand, to position female people as outsiders” [18, p. 125]. The girls Cherland observed turned to what some many consider “gendered” readings (including the Babysitters Club and Sweet Valley High series) to supplement the literature offered in school. This practice turn toward the reading of scholastically antithetical texts is labeled the “literate underlife” by Finders [8]. Finders writes of the agency of girls who read against the masculine grain of assigned fiction and who practice literacy in subversive ways by writing graffiti, passing and reading notes, and reading adolescent magazines and popular fiction: “Literate underlife created opportunities to disrupt the official, to document a refusal to embrace the obligations of the institution” [8, p. 118]. Thus, the action of reading in opposition to teacher‐prescribed norms becomes, in the eyes of Cherland and Finders, an act of rebellion.</p>\n",
       "<p>While the act of subversive reading may be a revolutionary one, theorists note that female readers actively negotiate the content of what some consider to be repressive and gendered texts as well. In Sherrie Inness’s collection of essays, <italic>Delinquents and Debutantes: Twentieth Century American Girls’ Cultures</italic>, a number of the writers note the tendency of readers to develop strategies for reading popular texts. Angela Hubler, writing of girls’ reading practices, notes, “[girl readers] commonly focused on aspects of texts that confirmed female behavior they found desirable while ignoring or forgetting aspects that undermined these behaviors,” and she concludes, “it is clear that girls are not blank slates that unthinkingly reproduce the ideological messages written upon them” [19, p. 281]. Cherland echoes this observation, writing, “the thoughts and emotions of the individual girls—their sense of themselves, and their ways of understanding their relation to the world are constituted as a dynamic process. … Each [girl reader] also creates and practices individual forms of resistance to these broad cultural forms” [18, p. 158]. There is a certain dynamism that occurs when girls read literature and texts created “just for them” Clearly, adolescent girl readers are engaged in a dialogue with the text not unlike the transaction suggested by Rosenblatt. While experience with a certain genre or text‐type has the potential to inform the future reading of similarly themed materials, the ultimate product of girls’ reading is the result of a number of textual and extratextual influences (e.g., Cherland’s “thoughts and emotions of … individual girls”).</p>\n",
       "<p>The practitioner’s dilemma in selecting these magazines for a school or public library collection arises as she weighs the consequences of supporting what Lehman and others deem the capitalist patriarchy that supports the publications themselves against the potential benefits associated with encouraging a “literate underlife.” If, as Cherland maintains, the public school curriculum confers male privilege via the assignment of “masculine” texts, the inclusion of feminized texts—like the teen magazines—in a school library’s collection might serve to bring female readers to voice. Operating under the assumption that girl readers are not passive consumers, we might discover that the girls’ reactions to and negotiations with these popular texts hone their critical literacy. Moreover, the greater availability of these magazines in schools and public libraries may foil the capitalist mechanism that supports their existence as fewer girls purchase in book and drug stores what they might read gratis during lunch period with a group of friends in the library.</p>\n",
       "<p>Teen magazines are powerful purveyors of image and identity. A cover spot on a hot teen magazine may guarantee a rising star success as well as boost sales of the publication. It is the inherent power relationship—between the teenage feminine interest (identity development, popular culture, relationship navigation) and the interests of the advertising agencies that influence magazine content—that is at the crux of the controversy surrounding the influence of teen magazines on their readers. The tone of intimacy and the creation of a feminine space between the pages of the publications mirror a self‐awareness intrinsic in adolescent development. To begin reading a girls’ teen magazine is to enter a world of self‐interest, a uniquely feminine world concerned with not only appearance but also bodily function and interpersonal relationships. Ironically, or perhaps appropriately, it is the towering influence of the capital driving the publication of such magazines that sours the experience. The inner space created within the magazine is tainted by the pervasive advertising content; the princess is despoiled but, by the grace of the grounded reader, maintains hope for rebirth.</p>\n",

       "'they call to us from newsstands and racks by grocery store checkouts the bright colors on their covers competing with the candy displays teen magazines are the literary sweet that satisfies the craving for normalcy. the covers of the latest teen magazines aimed at adolescent girls promise readers dates beauty and success and feature celebrity role models smiling beneath the mastheads. the experience of reading the glossy booklets seems ultimately depressing compared to the rich superstar singer the skinniest model even the glamorous writers the reader would require an identity facelift to compete with these supposed peers. yet teen magazines continue to flourish as in the last five years traditionally womens magazines have released little sister editions of their titles including the bestselling cosmogirl in  teentargeted magazines seventeen ym and cosmogirl were among abcs top  circulating magazines with average circulations of   and  respectively mpa resources. amid the arguments against these systematic monthly selfesteem deflators readership grows. what needs are being fulfilled by these monthly publications and what makes them such popular reading materialmagazines created for teenage girls are effective because of their developmental appropriateness the relationship developed between magazine and reader represents a distinct feminine space while the demands of the text itself are appropriate to the analytic ability of the adolescent. the inclusion of the confessional embarrassing story column that has become the mainstay of the teen magazine is a unique example of the sympathetic space created between reader and text by the magazines. the embarrassing stories content of these magazines is purposefully constructed not only to entertain but also to offer behavioral guidance the editors of these columns rely on specific hypotheses regarding adolescent literacy and development to maintain this dual function. by examining theories of adolescent identity development and the implied effects of environment on selfesteem building we can investigate the influence of teen magazines and their embarrassing stories on adolescent girls and theorizethrough the use of reader responsethe full impact of these texts.we may look to the discipline of developmental psychology to support our theory of the developmental appropriateness of teen magazines. psychologist erik erikson examined the effects of the environment on child development and concluded that in adolescence identity development is relative to gender. freudian psychology pronounced this presumption as well linking identity and selfconcept to recognition of gender however freuds identity construction theory is centered on one symbol. to freudian psychologists identity is created on the basis of genitalia one is the possessor of a phallus or one is not. on the contrary erikson theorizes that identity development begins with the recognition of ones gender as unique and not necessarily relative to its opposite. erikson has written it is never enough then to characterize the sexes by the way they differ from each other.  rather each sex is characterized by a uniqueness which includes but is not summed up by its difference from the other sex  . thus according to erikson identity begins in either sex with a positive construction not a relative or negative association with a power figure.eriksons theory of the uniqueness of gendered experience was developed after his observation of children at play and later by an iteration of tests of play construction. as erikson observed children playing with a prescribed set of constructing objects he noticed a difference in the theme of constructs based on sex. in evaluating a childs play construction i had to take into consideration the fact that girls and boys used space differently and that certain configurations occurred strikingly often in the constructions of one sex and rarely in those of the other noted erikson  p. . under eriksons observation boys had the tendency to build towers and tall buildings and then destroy these scenes in elaborate action sequences. girls constructions however were of interiors and included elaborate attention to the detail of the entrance of these buildings. each genders construction seemed categorically symbolic of sexual identity though neither employed the same language of symbol. that is instead of constructing an elaborate shrine to the phallus as freud may have expected girls celebrated the womb. these observations led erikson to believe that the recognition of sexual identity is not relative but singular.although erikson recognizes the female as unique and her experience as individuated he approaches gendered societal roles with fatalism. woman in many ways has kept her place within the typologies and cosmologies which men have had the exclusive opportunity to cultivate and to idolize writes erikson  p. . indeed though women can be blamed for their acceptance of the gendered status quo erikson does admit to a masculine influence in the preservation of the patriarchy no doubt there exists among men an honest sense of wishing to save  a sexual polarity  and an essential difference which they fear may be lost in too much sameness  p. . with these statements erikson implies a certain biologic determinism in the construction of sex or gender roles. this determinism is exemplified in the teen magazine itself the magazine is a form of placeholding within eriksons socalled typologies and cosmologies. while many magazines aimed at teenage girls preach girl power and even a political agency of sorts that the magazines notions of power are gendered confirms the preservation of eriksons sexual polarity. a static system is continually recreated as new generations of adolescents come of age and accept or absorb traditional ideas of their roles within a capitalist society.where do magazines fit in this relationship of maintenance and revolution are teenage girls like communist countries in need of democratization are magazines for girls mediated by capital and directed at females in a critical stage of development a tool to maintain the patriarchy joy leman in a criticism of womens magazines writes of the monthlies as media products and deems them part of an ideological apparatus presenting a view of the world which is at most points locked into the economics and political interests of the capitalist system  p. . dawn currie echoes this point in her study of teenage girls magazines teenzine messages are a product of the relations among various economic interests that include editors publishing houses and advertising agencies and their clients  p. . here currie identifies girls magazines and the messages within them as products of a greater capitalist mechanism. if we view capitalism as a masculine construction in which women cannot assert themselves we may also recognize womens magazines as an evil tool of this system. however an alternative view can be constructed via eriksons theories of identity development. womens and girls magazines celebrate the feminine inner space emphasized in the girls constructions and represent a forum albeit limited by advertising for issues of interest to females. angela mcrobbies recent work concerning womens and adolescent girls magazines has included critical remarks regarding the discursive tradition that would focus on the detrimental read nonfeminist nature of these publications. mcrobbie writes there remains an important relation between feminism and the world of girls and womens magazines the new intersections between them need to be examined in depth  p. .both erikson and fellow developmentalist jean piaget recognize the power of the peer group to influence identity development and the teen magazine as a guide is a peer group itself. piaget claims that the identification with a microcosm of society allows an individual to feel anchored in the world. the adolescent claims piaget views its own plans and activities as they relate to an idealized social group. the individual thus begins to think of itself as a fullfledged member of society  p. . the teen magazine with its images of corporeal perfection and promises of social success can be seen as evidence of a social ideal to which developing teens may aspire. selfdevelopment is referential and in varying ways influenced by an individuals alignment with a social group. such identification may lead an adolescent to form a mirror group or clique of her own. according to erikson the discomfort of adolescence when genital puberty floods body and imagination with all manner of impulses is assuaged by forming cliques and stereotyping themselves  p. . elizabeth heilman echoing erikson in  claims that the dominant class structure is additionally reinforced through the selfdetermined groupings of adolescents from different social class backgrounds  p. . the media are a direct source for images of social groupings as teens seek refuge in a socially safe category teen magazines in particular offer monthly images of social promise.the use of language particularly the cultivation of an inclusive narrative voice is a primary method employed by womens and girls magazines to create a feminine space. many girls magazines begin with a letter from the editor the intimate tone of which writes leman attempts to establish some kind of sisterly relationship between magazine and reader  p. . yms monthly letter from the editor is wrapped around candid snapshots of the editor herself the magazine staff and sometimes celebrities. teen magazines editorial letter is much less folksy and signed by the teen crew while cosmogirl usually features a closeup of editor atoosa rubenstein and invitations to contact her directly via email. according to erikson adolescent attachment to these glamorous sisterly role models is not uncommon. in fact the relationship encouraged between magazine and reader is developmentally significant. as adolescents look to their surroundings to mediate identity construction their willingness to put their trust in those peers and leading or misleading elders who will give imaginative if not illusory scope to their aspirations is only too obvious  p. . as teen magazines are peppered with images of physical perfection or societys definition thereof it would seem as if the first communication from this source the editors letter would foster a readers aspirations and serve to shape them through the magazines contents.the editors letter itself and the attention and importance given to this first and inviting communication mirrors a phenomenon observed by erikson. the elaboration of the entrances to girls play constructions symbolizes both the importance of the vagina as gateway and the symbolic importance of any entry to intimacy. the pseudopersonal note from the editor to the readers of the teen magazine is an embodiment to this attention to detail. the intimate knowledgeable tone taken by the editor in the introduction is a careful seduction and celebration of the magazines interior. this gentle welcome within the first pages of the teen magazine is clearly significant both developmentally and symbolically.this introductory letter from the editor serves both to mask the adultestablishment influence on the magazines publication and to encourage young readers ownership of the text. margaret finders in just girls hidden literacies and life in junior high has observed the effects of this construction while  adults produce these teen magazines the girls perceived zines as exclusively their own.  they never acknowledged any adult presence behind the youthful images  p. . although the teen magazines editors may indeed be adults the portraits that accompany their editors letters are in finderss words youthful. cosmogirls atoosa rubensteins recent photograph depicts the twentysomething editor in a tight sleeveless tshirt with glowing skin and a confident smile rubenstein looks like the fantasy older sister. moreover rubensteins invitation to write to her  at her email address increases this perception of intimacy. yms opening statement from editor christina kelly is presented in a handwritten font looks like a note that might be passed during a boring class and features a snapshot of kelly clipped to the text. finders continues by concealing any adult presence teen zines were embraced by early adolescent females as their own  p. . the image of the teen magazine as a guiding publication edited by hip young women is cultivated in the editors letter the presumably suitwearing middleaged business people who financially support the magazines production and the advertising executives who influence the magazines content are distinctly absent personalities from the literal text.the content of many monthly girls magazines may represent to the teen reader the parameters of available identity. in a  published study of the content of teen magazines evans and associates examined patterns of content in three of the then most widely circulated teen magazines sassy ym and seventeen. evans and associates found a prevalent double message embedded in the contents of the observed magazines although ostensibly governed by the theme of selfimprovement these publications seem to approach the topic largely through fashion dressing and physical beautification  p. . while fashion and beauty care dominated the magazines in evanss study the results note articles about interpersonal relations constituted the most frequent category of identity themes  and included articles about dating and heterosexuality  followed by general peer relations  and family issues  p. . erikson student and psychologist carol gilligan would find the magazines emphasis on interpersonal relationships developmentally apt as she postulates that adolescence is the period during which girls begin to navigate more complex relationships with peers. gilligan writes as girls on the edge of adolescence gain cognitive and emotional capacities to know the relational world in new ways  they begin to grasp the realities of relationships and of womens lives in new ways  p. .enter the teen magazine with its plethora of advice columns from various experts and monthly quizzes to gauge normalcy. by addressing the issues at the forefront of adolescent concerns teen magazines build a near impenetrable front of influence in the lives of adolescent girls. in addition the teen magazine encourages a metarelationshipa relationship with itself. finders again cites the invisibility of adults as an explanation of this relationship the invisibility of adults and the strong sense of sameness may have fostered a sense of seamless connection between their friends and experiences and those in the zines.  lacking a critical distance that fiction creates zines were received as truths  p. . through the personalization of the messages within the invitational editors letter the participatory quizzes the publication of reader letters and concerns teen magazines seek to foster a relationship between the girl and the publication.teen magazines offer illusory personalized messages to readers via the interactive components of the magazine includingbut not limited tothe letters to the editors advice columns embarrassing story submissions and quizzes. this illusion of personalization and even agency not always found in young adult novels may be what makes adolescent magazines an important and even necessary part of a library collection. among the conclusions currie documents in her study the analysis of these interactive components of the magazines is of particular interest. currie exposes the illusion of agency such columns promise writing as in advice columns in quizzes  the text offers the seeming pleasure of writing self if the reader is to be rated a successfulhence normalperson this writing must fall within the narrow confines of the values promoted elsewhere in the magazine  . currie argues that this kind of negotiationbetween the subject and the textproduces a subjectivity constantly engaged in selfregulation and normalization  p.  to the ends prescribed by the magazine itself. catherine driscoll assumes a similar stance in her ethnography of adolescent girls in western popular culture writing girls magazines foreground both selfsurveillance and selfproduction most explicitly in the problem pages and other scenarios of guidance  p. .ultimately currie concludes that the lived experiences of adolescent girls are not radically different enough from the prescriptions the magazines suggest to encourage individual formation of alternative modes of subjectivity. citing the normalizing power of school culture currie writes that girls experiences in school reinforce or are reinforced by magazine images of femininity. while girls recognize that magazine standards of feminine beauty are unrealistic experience tells them that the cultural mandate to be beautiful conveyed by these texts is real claims currie  p. . in conclusion currie writes the power of the text lies in its demonstrated ability not only to construct a reading subject who accepts dominant definitions of being a woman but also to normalize the dominant order as it is experienced through school culture  p. . magazines seek to document and reproduce the social world of adolescents this textual mirror may offer a truthful enough representation of teen life that the improving suggestions of the publication become normalized and not extreme. that is the lived experiences of teenage girls are not directly informed via literal translations of magazine texts. however the extranormalizing power of these teenzines is a real consequence of their reading.the relationship created between reader and magazine is fostered through text the naturalness with which the words can be read and the articles arguments understood pacifies the reader and may allow her to drift more willingly into the space created between publication and reader. by understanding the cognitive development of adolescents magazine publishers and writers can take advantage of the appropriateness of certain texts and vocabularies. according to piaget early adolescents at the formal operational level are just beginning to apply operations not only to objects but to hypotheses formulated in words  p. . the teen magazine as developmental guide is rife with hypothetical identities under the guidance of the editors a reader may contemplate presumably through manipulation of fashion and makeup for example a number of personalities. the illustrations of these potential selves are constructed and made more effective by utilizing specific and timely terminology. for example while a teen magazine like ym or cosmogirl may not employ the most sophisticated vocabulary or metaphor the use of teenspecific slang makes the text nearly incomprehensible to those readers outside the influence of teen culture.the inclusion of readerwritten embarrassing anecdotes has heightened the popularity of many teen magazines the developmental appropriateness of this magazine mainstay in which social guidance is offered in the guise of commiseration should be of particular notice. the texts of these columns titled say anything in ym trauma rama in seventeen and why me in teen consist of a collection of embarrassing incidents in the magazine readers lives. readers are encouraged to write to the magazines editors with their own tales which if published will garner ratings on an editorial scale. ym rates its readers tales with a system of stars a singlestar rating translates to a sympathetic glad it didnt happen to me a fourstar humiliation offers the advice better switch school districts. teen magazine utilizes a rating system based on flames oneflame stories are considered less embarrassing than stories rated with four flames. seventeen uses a threetiered rating scale and offers a sarcastic one or two sentence commentary on each anecdote. although the submitted tales are supposedly the work of magazine readers the jargon and tone of the stories themselves belie either a strict reader adherence to the slang and writing style of the magazine or heavy editing. the anecdotes may reference certain popular teen styles by designer name or use teenspecific shorthand like b.f. for best friend or b.f.f. for best female friend to create a tone of inclusion.as with the editors letter the embarrassing stories column utilizes developmentally appropriate text and mimics an interaction between the reader and the publication to encourage readership. the encouragement of submissions as well as the rating of those published writings suggests a real communication between magazine reader and magazine staff. the ratings or comments issued by the magazine staff imply an interactive empathy and personal interaction not unlike that created in the editors letter. occasional inclusion of celebrity shame and staff humiliations serves to widen the empathetic discursive community created in this column.that the experience of shared humiliation is used in this context to encourage readership may seem to be exemplary of the final exit of good taste within publishing. christopher lasch writes in a  new republic article concerning shame and the creation of a seemingly uncensored media is there anything our culture still attempts to conceal  nothing can shock us anymore least of all intimate revelations about personal life. the mass media do not hesitate to parade the most outlandish perversions the most degraded appetites  p. . when reading of a fellow teens traumatic experience involving a leaking maxipad and a lightcolored dress or the humiliation involved in passing loud gas during a silent chemistry test it does seem as if no barriers exist between the personal and the publishable. however these texts included in teen magazines and written in a manufactured teen voice are not only developmentally appropriate but also socially instructive.in an overview of the psychological studies related to the emotion of shame thomas j. scheff cites  eliass treatment of shame as the most inclusive. according to scheff elias shows that many of the principal sources of shame in modern societies are the body functions ones appearance and ones emotions p.  and that these sources of shame are relatively new. elias shows how shame was being used to socialize feelings about sexuality etiquette and emotion by the nineteenth century  p. . these sources of humiliation still make up the landscape of embarrassment described in the teen texts. when examining the experiences catalogued in teen tales of embarrassment these circumstances are very often mined for humiliating content.in an analysis of six months of embarrassing stories content published in  in three leading teen magazinesteen seventeen and ym all of which were located in a noncirculating collection in my local librarya number of thematic consistencies became visible. within each collection scenarios related to teen social encounters rule breaking and physical control showcased teen and often gender specific landscapes as potential etiquette minefields. the subjects of these stories were coded with the following thematic titles showing too much interest in a boy amorous errors accidental nudity partial or complete underwear mention of or view unworn menstrual period including the surprise onset of a menstrual period or the view by others of any feminine hygiene product beauty blunders clothes hair or makeup mistakes noticed by and remarked upon by others showing off accidents that occur when the narrator is vying for attention clumsiness stood up by date bathroomexcrement related caught making out caught breaking rules including school rules or household rules general etiquette and other various errors. while some of the incidents described in the texts illustrate deviance from generally socially understood mores general etiquette caught breaking rules the chronicling of the other less universally understood scenarios serve to as scheff writes socialize feeling about sexuality etiquette and emotion specific to the behavior of adolescent girls. clearly teenaged girls caught out of control making out with a partner showing off to attract attention applying makeup with a heavy or an uneducated hand risk embarrassment and social alienation. the teenaged reader made aware of the risks of certain behaviors in certain scenarios can by studying these columns develop a literal vocabulary of humiliation while absorbing subtextual societal rules.the data included in the figures attached to this research are indicative of an initial and individual reading of the collected embarrassing stories. verification of these findings occurred later and involved the rereading of the texts by the primary investigator and the reading and evaluation of the texts by a secondary reader. in the reading process each reader was asked to code the embarrassing stories in terms of their aboutness and based on a list of subject headings created for this purpose. the aboutness or the subject of each anecdote was to be considered the thing afforded matter or action of a specified kind a ground motive or cause from the oxford english dictionarys definition of subject. that is though the general theme of all the narratives was embarrassment or embarrassing stories the subject selections reference the potential causes of the humiliations described.by tabulating the occurrences of agreement among readers of aboutness a measure of cohens kappa used as an index of interrater reliability was computed. the initial measurement of kappa was insignificant where satisfactory reliability is said to occur with a measurement of . the findings here were only reliable at .. further examination of the data showed that the significanceaffecting disagreement between readers regarded distinguishing the differences between embarrassing events occurring as a result of general clumsiness or as a result of accidents occurring while the narrator was showing off. a hypothetical merging of this data into a single category increased the measurement of kappa past the significant mark. the lack of terminological clarity that seemed to have negatively affected the reliability measurement may be considered a methodological error stricter adherence to the codes of scientific content analysis in an iteration of this examination may allow for more reliable and conclusive statistical data. additional numeric inconclusiveness may have been a result of the gender of the readers. a comparison of the subject assignments of a body of male readers and a body of female readers may address the issue of the gendered nature of the texts and the meaning making implications of such a finding.within the narratives certain phrases were used with frequency to emphasize the dire nature of the embarrassing situation and to heighten the humiliation stakes. according to these anecdotes often the embarrassing act is a secondary source of unease the audience of the act can determine the level of shame conveyed in the text. any embarrassment witnessed by the entire school or entire grade performed before the most popular boy girl or clique or meant to impress the bestlooking or hottest teacher or boy was almost certain to rate higher on the humiliation scale than lowerstakes scenarios. in these anecdotes embarrassment was not necessarily selfdetermined the level of shame was a product of the status of the watchers. this observation is notable both on a discursive and societal level. the drama of the setup for the embarrassing story is heightened by the description of the highstakes audience involved. that the narrators social standing may be in the balance makes the experience of reading the tale all the more delicious. additionally a reader may absorb the implication that she as a female as a character secondary to the popular clique or the bestlooking boy will consistently occupy the object position in both the reallife tale and in her own life. the internalization of the concept of the self as secondary of womanhood as a performance may be a byproduct of these intentionally sympathetic stories.the embarrassing stories content in teen magazines utilize a specific vocabulary of foreshadowing frequent readers of these columns may become adept at interpreting the magazines unique code of prescience. louise rosenblatt writes that a reader brings her own experiences to a text and that these experiences shape the reading of a work for an individual. these experiences may include knowledge of another language situational experiences similar to the conflicts portrayed in the literature or exposure to specific cultural symbols and mores. rosenblatt writes that the words on the page encourage the reader to draw on his past experiences with what the words point to in life and literature. the text presents these words in a new and unique pattern. out of these he is enabled actually to mold a new experience the literary work  p. . in the case of adolescent magazines embarrassing stories a specific language of prediction is honed as readers accumulate experiences with a text.the acquisition of an embarrassing stories vocabulary becomes part of what rosenblatt would deem a literary experience the readers fluency in this vocabulary will inform her reading of the stories themselves. for example often in the tales of menstrual mistakes the mention of a white dress worn by the protagonist hints at a forthcoming menstrual disaster. that a ruined white or lightcolored dress or outfit becomes code for the ultimate menstrual mistake is of special note the evidence of womanhood itself as displayed in a clothing stain is an ironic and distinctly genderspecific source of embarrassment to portray in a teenage girls magazine. that the merest hint of a girls menstrual period is the source of embarrassment is evidenced in the tales involving the accidental sighting of wrapped tampons or the purchase of feminine hygiene items. additional harbingers of doom include the mention of special attention paid to appearancehair clothes and makeupin anticipation of a particular often romantic encounter these best laid plans can fail when a newly laundered outfit attracts a pair of staticy underpants a trendy pair of jeans gets wet and bleeds dye on the wearer or a tight pair of pants splits as the wearer bends over to attract a male.the cultivation of a specific vocabulary of suspense and foreshadowing that is granted meaning from the context in which it is situated is a phenomenon present here and described in readerresponse theory. following rosenblatt we can hypothesize that the readers past experiences with reading similarly themed tales allow her to predict the scenario of humiliation explicated in each embarrassing text. this predictability grants a certain power to the experienced reader that is unavailable to the stories narrators while the narrator of an embarrassing story fails to anticipate the humiliation to come the readerfluent in the language of the texthas likely foreseen the embarrassment described later. this foresight is a predictive gift cultivated by the reader as she reads one that bestows on her a certain prescient textual power. the reallife application of this reading is less agential with the literal narrative absent in her living world the teen reader learns to edit her own movements in anticipation and avoidance of the outcomes described in the embarrassing stories.although the embarrassing stories can be categorized by subject or anecdote see table  a less granular approach to analysis reveals three primary themes discussed throughout the columns behavior with boys body function and intimate exposure. behavior with boys is discussed and analyzed at length in these columns heterosexual relations are characterized as fraught with potential hazards. embarrassing anecdotes of amorous errors include in an issue of seventeen a tale of a weldedtogether pair whose braces and lip jewelry linked together nearly inextricably. getting caught in a clinch by parents brothers and sisters or teachers is the source of much humiliation as is showing too much interest in a member of the opposite sex. stories dealing with the functions of the body centered mainly around menstrual period disasters with ym devoting an entire months column to menstrual stories. stories falling under the intimate exposure category include both accidental nudity and the exposure of or mention of a narrators underwear. the mere mention of or glimpse of the underwear proved embarrassing even if the underwear was unworn that is viewed in a drawer or backpack. these three general categories can be easily mapped onto eliass per scheff primary sources of shame the body functions mapped to body functions ones appearance mapped to intimate exposure and ones emotions mapped to amorous errors. while scheff and elias may argue that their thematic categories are universal as the categories are recalled in the pages of adolescent girls magazines their treatment becomes distinctly gendered. see tables  and .tableembarrassing incidentsembarrassing actoccurrences ymoccurrences seventeenoccurrences teennnnshowing too much interest in a boy...amorous errors..accidental

described in ym and seventeen involved some kind of social or corporeal control. the reader learning from and laughing with these texts may absorb the socializing shorthand present beneath the text. if feminine success is measured by the avoidance of humiliations as great as those published the social lessons taught in the magazines columns involve decreasing participation in events that could lead to the outcomes depicted. a certain social paranoia may emerge in the reader who absorbs the identity of the watchful woman who must be ever vigilant guarding her intimate apparel from view avoiding revealing clothing and maintaining the secrecy surrounding menstruation or any bodily function. luise eichenbaum and susie orbach identified these ideas of selfdenial and feminine presentation in their  book understanding women a feminist psychoanalytic approach. according to eichenbaum and orbach the exhibition of the edited self is learned in childhood observation the little girl absorbs the idea that to get love and approval she must show a particular side of herself. she must hide her emotional cravings her disappointments and her angers.  she must hide her self. she comes to feel that there must be something wrong with who she really is which in turn must mean there is something wrong with what she needs and what she wants  p. .the teen magazine may further this concept with its embarrassing stories based on their exploitation of social donts the female reader may learn to associate some of her natural inclinations menstruation sexuality with inappropriateness. the irreverent and genuinely humorous content of these columns of embarrassing stories attracts readers while the use of developmentally appropriate language and topical subject matter furthers an agenda of social control.the eventual outcome of the internalization of these rules may already have been predicted by eichenbaum and orbach slowly the girl develops an acceptable self one that appears selfsufficient and capable and will receive more consistent acceptance  p. . taylor l. a teen writing of a regifting humiliation for teens embarrassing stories page illustrates the discomfort resulting from the false fronting i pretended to laugh with the other students laughing at me but deep down i felt like barfing.although teen magazines may be seen as gross influences on girls identity development it is important to theorize the effects of the discourse and to examine how readers of these magazines navigate the text. readerresponse theorist arthur applebee links readers responses to text to development mainly following piagets theorized stages of development. during adolescence the resources of formal operations have a dramatic effect on the childs response to literature theorizes applebee  p. . as readers mature their ability to relate to and draw conclusions from a text increases in scope and complexity. applebee claims that as readers enter the initial stages of formal operations their ability to analyze a text in terms of their own experiences is developed. this onetoone relationship between reader experience and text is complicated as the reader reaches the later stage of formal operations and begins to see the text as one of many statements of how life might be understood rather than simply a presentation of life as it is  p. . the initial period of text relation begins around age  or coincidentally in the continuum of most teen magazines target marketsand grows in analytic complexity around age . here we may see the window of time marked by personal relation to textpiagets initial stage of formal operations and applebees early stage of analytic abilitya unique period of vulnerability to developmental influence through text.developmentalists psychologists and even readerresponse theorists characterize the period of adolescence as a period of shifting paradigms. erikson writes of the painful selfawareness of the teen years and the struggle to attach to a frame of reference outside the self on which to build identity. piaget associates adolescence with the increasing ability to perform complex tasks while applebee applies this cognitive growth to literacy and the experience of reading. teen magazines constructed with this convoluted time of physical and cognitive development in mind do answer the needs of adolescent readers. by providing a framework for identity growth supplying images of societal perfection and taking advantage of the onetoone relationship that can be forged between reader and text magazines for teenagers as well as those for adults effectively guide identity development. the narrowness of this identity framework as well as the normalcy promised if the guidelines described in the magazines are followed is a source of critique identified by driscoll through a cult of normality and an eroticisation of the adolescent womans concern with normalizing her body the feminine adolescent body is constructed in girls magazines as a range of desires trespassed upon by a variety of physiological imperfections  p. . clearly driscoll and others acknowledge the successfulness of these publications in defining the parameters of identity and encouraging the marketing of these identities to teenaged readers. the effectiveness of these magazines to shape the identities of readers is rarely called into question on the contrary it is the shape of the identities the publications advocate that is more often argued.after reading earnest letters from the editors of teen magazines to the thousands of readers who purchase the publication each month it becomes difficult to situate the friendly and helpful intent of the magazine staff within a greater context of capitalism and accusations of exploitation. joy leman reminds us that the incantations of false intimacy are foregroundeda discourse of friendliness reassuring and relocating women in an idea of oppression and a position of exploitation are present in every issue  p. . indeed according to leman the developmental needs of girls can be manipulated to serve the status quo and to maintain the profit motivations that sustain girls monthlies. in a power relationship mirroring capitalism the teen magazine creates its own audience and thus its own sustenance. as ideals are marketed and branded within the glossy pages advertisers pay to incorporate themselves within the identity for sale. according to ross ballaster and colleagues the use of a feminine discourse the manipulation and creation of gendered needs answered by advertised products and the construction of the female reader as consumer is intrinsic to the survival of the magazines and the market that supports them. defining women as not men  is evidently not a sufficient one for the womens magazine reports ballaster in a  analysis of womens publications. if women are to buy and to be they cannot be defined solely in the negative femininity has to be given a particular content  p. . here femininity is advertised as a shifting product an identity dependent on the consumption of goods or the application of products. more important this advertising is displayed in a uniquely feminine space erikson where as ballaster writes women are more than just not men.because of the developmental appropriateness of teen magazines their influence on identity development has the potential to be great. however opponents of the magazine argue that the identities illustrated between the pagesgirlfriend model student woman sexual beingare often considered insignificant weak or even degrading. this weakness is an illusion founded on a history marked by the limited documentation of the participation of women in socalled relevant historical activity. the identity historically accepted by womenincluding the feminine virtues of passive goodness personal service to others and devotion to the domestic sphere  p. has been limited not just by a conspiracy of patriarchy but by every woman who blindly accepts the supposed weakness associated with this identity. by escaping the idea of the female as notmale and associating femaleness with pleasure and attractiveness  p.  as young girls did in an iteration of eriksons study a uniquely feminine power may be cultivated. furthermore perhaps the perception of weakness or insignificant success lies in the frame we draw around womens accomplishments and identities. the female space women create and celebrate is markedly different from the male power symbol and cannot be evaluated in the same way. recognizing the strength in both models of power and identity may be the first step toward a goal of parity and a loosening of societal restraints binding womens identities.while some teen magazines may be dismissed as fluff by teachers and librarians researchers examining the practice of literacy remark on the agency associated with reading popular texts. meredith cherland in an examination of girls reading practices in a canadian elementary and junior high school encourages us to view the popular reading of teenage girls outside of school assignments as recursive. cherland drawing from giroux writes that girls popular reading goes against the hidden curriculum present in many schools that would equate the male experience  with human experience.  literature assigned in the school cherland observed  served on the one hand to validate only mans experience of the world and on the other hand to position female people as outsiders  p. . the girls cherland observed turned to what some many consider gendered readings including the babysitters club and sweet valley high series to supplement the literature offered in school. this practice turn toward the reading of scholastically antithetical texts is labeled the literate underlife by finders . finders writes of the agency of girls who read against the masculine grain of assigned fiction and who practice literacy in subversive ways by writing graffiti passing and reading notes and reading adolescent magazines and popular fiction literate underlife created opportunities to disrupt the official to document a refusal to embrace the obligations of the institution  p. . thus the action of reading in opposition to teacherprescribed norms becomes in the eyes of cherland and finders an act of rebellion.while the act of subversive reading may be a revolutionary one theorists note that female readers actively negotiate the content of what some consider to be repressive and gendered texts as well. in sherrie innesss collection of essays delinquents and debutantes twentieth century american girls cultures a number of the writers note the tendency of readers to develop strategies for reading popular texts. angela hubler writing of girls reading practices notes girl readers commonly focused on aspects of texts that confirmed female behavior they found desirable while ignoring or forgetting aspects that undermined these behaviors and she concludes it is clear that girls are not blank slates that unthinkingly reproduce the ideological messages written upon them  p. . cherland echoes this observation writing the thoughts and emotions of the individual girlstheir sense of themselves and their ways of understanding their relation to the world are constituted as a dynamic process.  each girl reader also creates and practices individual forms of resistance to these broad cultural forms  p. . there is a certain dynamism that occurs when girls read literature and texts created just for them clearly adolescent girl readers are engaged in a dialogue with the text not unlike the transaction suggested by rosenblatt. while experience with a certain genre or texttype has the potential to inform the future reading of similarly themed materials the ultimate product of girls reading is the result of a number of textual and extratextual influences e.g. cherlands thoughts and emotions of  individual girls.the practitioners dilemma in selecting these magazines for a school or public library collection arises as she weighs the consequences of supporting what lehman and others deem the capitalist patriarchy that supports the publications themselves against the potential benefits associated with encouraging a literate underlife. if as cherland maintains the public school curriculum confers male privilege via the assignment of masculine texts the inclusion of feminized textslike the teen magazinesin a school librarys collection might serve to bring female readers to voice. operating under the assumption that girl readers are not passive consumers we might discover that the girls reactions to and negotiations with these popular texts hone their critical literacy. moreover the greater availability of these magazines in schools and public libraries may foil the capitalist mechanism that supports their existence as fewer girls purchase in book and drug stores what they might read gratis during lunch period with a group of friends in the library.teen magazines are powerful purveyors of image and identity. a cover spot on a hot teen magazine may guarantee a rising star success as well as boost sales of the publication. it is the inherent power relationshipbetween the teenage feminine interest identity development popular culture relationship navigation and the interests of the advertising agencies that influence magazine contentthat is at the crux of the controversy surrounding the influence of teen magazines on their readers. the tone of intimacy and the creation of a feminine space between the pages of the publications mirror a selfawareness intrinsic in adolescent development. to begin reading a girls teen magazine is to enter a world of selfinterest a uniquely feminine world concerned with not only appearance but also bodily function and interpersonal relationships. ironically or perhaps appropriately it is the towering influence of the capital driving the publication of such magazines that sours the experience. the inner space created within the magazine is tainted by the pervasive advertising content the princess is despoiled but by the grace of the grounded reader maintains hope for rebirth.'"

feminine space while the demands of the text itself are appropriate to the analytic ability of the adolescent.', 'the inclusion of the confessional embarrassing story column that has become the mainstay of the teen magazine is a unique example of the sympathetic space created between reader and text by the magazines.', 'the embarrassing stories content of these magazines is purposefully constructed not only to entertain but also to offer behavioral guidance the editors of these columns rely on specific hypotheses regarding adolescent literacy and development to maintain this dual function.', 'by examining theories of adolescent identity development and the implied effects of environment on selfesteem building we can investigate the influence of teen magazines and their embarrassing stories on adolescent girls and theorizethrough the use of reader responsethe full impact of these texts.we may look to the discipline of developmental psychology to support our theory of the developmental appropriateness of teen magazines.', 'psychologist erik erikson examined the effects of the environment on child development and concluded that in adolescence identity development is relative to gender.', 'freudian psychology pronounced this presumption as well linking identity and selfconcept to recognition of gender however freuds identity construction theory is centered on one symbol.', 'to freudian psychologists identity is created on the basis of genitalia one is the possessor of a phallus or one is not.', 'on the contrary erikson theorizes that identity development begins with the recognition of ones gender as unique and not necessarily relative to its opposite.', 'erikson has written it is never enough then to characterize the sexes by the way they differ from each other.', 'rather each sex is characterized by a uniqueness which includes but is not summed up by its difference from the other sex  .', 'thus according to erikson identity begins in either sex with a positive construction not a relative or negative association with a power figure.eriksons theory of the uniqueness of gendered experience was developed after his observation of children at play and later by an iteration of tests of play construction.', 'as erikson observed children playing with a prescribed set of constructing objects he noticed a difference in the theme of constructs based on sex.', 'in evaluating a childs play construction i had to take into consideration the fact that girls and boys used space differently and that certain configurations occurred strikingly often in the constructions of one sex and rarely in those of the other noted erikson  p. .', 'under eriksons observation boys had the tendency to build towers and tall buildings and then destroy these scenes in elaborate action sequences.', 'girls constructions however were of interiors and included elaborate attention to the detail of the entrance of these buildings.', 'each genders construction seemed categorically symbolic of sexual identity though neither employed the same language of symbol.', 'that is instead of constructing an elaborate shrine to the phallus as freud may have expected girls celebrated the womb.', 'these observations led erikson to believe that the recognition of sexual identity is not relative but singular.although erikson recognizes the female as unique and her experience as individuated he approaches gendered societal roles with fatalism.', 'woman in many ways has kept her place within the typologies and cosmologies which men have had the exclusive opportunity to cultivate and to idolize writes erikson  p. .', 'indeed though women can be blamed for their acceptance of the gendered status quo erikson does admit to a masculine influence in the preservation of the patriarchy no doubt there exists among men an honest sense of wishing to save  a sexual polarity  and an essential difference which they fear may be lost in too much sameness  p. .', 'with these statements erikson implies a certain biologic determinism in the construction of sex or gender roles.', 'this determinism is exemplified in the teen magazine itself the magazine is a form of placeholding within eriksons socalled typologies and cosmologies.', 'while many magazines aimed at teenage girls preach girl power and even a political agency of sorts that the magazines notions of power are gendered confirms the preservation of eriksons sexual polarity.', 'a static system is continually recreated as new generations of adolescents come of age and accept or absorb traditional ideas of their roles within a capitalist society.where do magazines fit in this relationship of maintenance and revolution are teenage girls like communist countries in need of democratization are magazines for girls mediated by capital and directed at females in a critical stage of development a tool to maintain the patriarchy joy leman in a criticism of womens magazines writes of the monthlies as media products and deems them part of an ideological apparatus presenting a view of the world which is at most points locked into the economics and political interests of the capitalist system  p. .', 'dawn currie echoes this point in her study of teenage girls magazines teenzine messages are a product of the relations among various economic interests that include editors publishing houses and advertising agencies and their clients  p. .', 'here currie identifies girls magazines and the messages within them as products of a greater capitalist mechanism.', 'if we view capitalism as a masculine construction in which women cannot assert themselves we may also recognize womens magazines as an evil tool of this system.', 'however an alternative view can be constructed via eriksons theories of identity development.', 'womens and girls magazines celebrate the feminine inner space emphasized in the girls constructions and represent a forum albeit limited by advertising for issues of interest to females.', 'angela mcrobbies recent work concerning womens and adolescent girls magazines has included critical remarks regarding the discursive tradition that would focus on the detrimental read nonfeminist nature of these publications.', 'mcrobbie writes there remains an important relation between feminism and the world of girls and womens magazines the new intersections between them need to be examined in depth  p. .both erikson and fellow developmentalist jean piaget recognize the power of the peer group to influence identity development and the teen magazine as a guide is a peer group itself.', 'piaget claims that the identification with a microcosm of society allows an individual to feel anchored in the world.', 'the adolescent claims piaget views its own plans and activities as they relate to an idealized social group.', 'the individual thus begins to think of itself as a fullfledged member of society  p. .', 'the teen magazine with its images of corporeal perfection and promises of social success can be seen as evidence of a social ideal to which developing teens may aspire.', 'selfdevelopment is referential and in varying ways influenced by an individuals alignment with a social group.', 'such identification may lead an adolescent to form a mirror group or clique of her own.', 'according to erikson the discomfort of adolescence when genital puberty floods body and imagination with all manner of impulses is assuaged by forming cliques and stereotyping themselves  p. .', 'elizabeth heilman echoing erikson in  claims that the dominant class structure is additionally reinforced through the selfdetermined groupings of adolescents from different social class backgrounds  p. .', 'the media are a direct source for images of social groupings as teens seek refuge in a socially safe category teen magazines in particular offer monthly images of social promise.the use of language particularly the cultivation of an inclusive narrative voice is a primary method employed by womens and girls magazines to create a feminine space.', 'many girls magazines begin with a letter from the editor the intimate tone of which writes leman attempts to establish some kind of sisterly relationship between magazine and reader  p. .', 'yms monthly letter from the editor is wrapped around candid snapshots of the editor herself the magazine staff and sometimes celebrities.', 'teen magazines editorial letter is much less folksy and signed by the teen crew while cosmogirl usually features a closeup of editor atoosa rubenstein and invitations to contact her directly via email.', 'according to erikson adolescent attachment to these glamorous sisterly role models is not uncommon.', 'in fact the relationship encouraged between magazine and reader is developmentally significant.', 'as adolescents look to their surroundings to mediate identity construction their willingness to put their trust in those peers and leading or misleading elders who will give imaginative if not illusory scope to their aspirations is only too obvious  p. .', 'as teen magazines are peppered with images of physical perfection or societys definition thereof it would seem as if the first communication from this source the editors letter would foster a readers aspirations and serve to shape them through the magazines contents.the editors letter itself and the attention and importance given to this first and inviting communication mirrors a phenomenon observed by erikson.', 'the elaboration of the entrances to girls play constructions symbolizes both the importance of the vagina as gateway and the symbolic importance of any entry to intimacy.', 'the pseudopersonal note from the editor to the readers of the teen magazine is an embodiment to this attention to detail.', 'the intimate knowledgeable tone taken by the editor in the introduction is a careful seduction and celebration of the magazines interior.', 'this gentle welcome within the first pages of the teen magazine is clearly significant both developmentally and symbolically.this introductory letter from the editor serves both to mask the adultestablishment influence on the magazines publication and to encourage young readers ownership of the text.', 'margaret finders in just girls hidden literacies and life in junior high has observed the effects of this construction while  adults produce these teen magazines the girls perceived zines as exclusively their own.', 'they never acknowledged any adult presence behind the youthful images  p. .', 'although the teen magazines editors may indeed be adults the portraits that accompany their editors letters are in finderss words youthful.', 'cosmogirls atoosa rubensteins recent photograph depicts the twentysomething editor in a tight sleeveless tshirt with glowing skin and a confident smile rubenstein looks like the fantasy older sister.', 'moreover rubensteins invitation to write to her  at her email address increases this perception of intimacy.', 'yms opening statement from editor christina kelly is presented in a handwritten font looks like a note that might be passed during a boring class and features a snapshot of kelly clipped to the text.', 'finders continues by concealing any adult presence teen zines were embraced by early adolescent females as their own  p. .', 'the image of the teen magazine as a guiding publication edited by hip young women is cultivated in the editors letter the presumably suitwearing middleaged business people who financially support the magazines production and the advertising executives who influence the magazines content are distinctly absent personalities from the literal text.the content of many monthly girls magazines may represent to the teen reader the parameters of available identity.', 'in a  published study of the content of teen magazines evans and associates examined patterns of content in three of the then most widely circulated teen magazines sassy ym and seventeen.', 'evans and associates found a prevalent double message embedded in the contents of the observed magazines although ostensibly governed by the theme of selfimprovement these publications seem to approach the topic largely through fashion dressing and physical beautification  p. .', 'while fashion and beauty care dominated the magazines in evanss study the results note articles about interpersonal relations constituted the most frequent category of identity themes  and included articles about dating and heterosexuality  followed by general peer relations  and family issues  p. .', 'erikson student and psychologist carol gilligan would find the magazines emphasis on interpersonal relationships developmentally apt as she postulates that adolescence is the period during which girls begin to navigate more complex relationships with peers.', 'gilligan writes as girls on the edge of adolescence gain cognitive and emotional capacities to know the relational world in new ways  they begin to grasp the realities of relationships and of womens lives in new ways  p. .enter the teen magazine with its plethora of advice columns from various experts and monthly quizzes to gauge normalcy.', 'by addressing the issues at the forefront of adolescent concerns teen magazines build a near impenetrable front of influence in the lives of adolescent girls.', 'in addition the teen magazine encourages a metarelationshipa relationship with itself.', 'finders again cites the invisibility of adults as an explanation of this relationship the invisibility of adults and the strong sense of sameness may have fostered a sense of seamless connection between their friends and experiences and those in the zines.', 'lacking a critical distance that fiction creates zines were received as truths  p. .', 'through the personalization of the messages within the invitational editors letter the participatory quizzes the publication of reader letters and concerns teen magazines seek to foster a relationship between the girl and the publication.teen magazines offer illusory personalized messages to readers via the interactive components of the magazine includingbut not limited tothe letters to the editors advice columns embarrassing story submissions and quizzes.', 'this illusion of personalization and even agency not always found in young adult novels may be what makes adolescent magazines an important and even necessary part of a library collection.', 'among the conclusions currie documents in her study the analysis of these interactive components of the magazines is of particular interest.', 'currie exposes the illusion of agency such columns promise writing as in advice columns in quizzes  the text offers the seeming pleasure of writing self if the reader is to be rated a successfulhence normalperson this writing must fall within the narrow confines of the values promoted elsewhere in the magazine  .', 'currie argues that this kind of negotiationbetween the subject and the textproduces a subjectivity constantly engaged in selfregulation and normalization  p.  to the ends prescribed by the magazine itself.', 'catherine driscoll assumes a similar stance in her ethnography of adolescent girls in western popular culture writing girls magazines foreground both selfsurveillance and selfproduction most explicitly in the problem pages and other scenarios of guidance  p. .ultimately currie concludes that the lived experiences of adolescent girls are not radically different enough from the prescriptions the magazines suggest to encourage individual formation of alternative modes of subjectivity.', 'citing the normalizing power of school culture currie writes that girls experiences in school reinforce or are reinforced by magazine images of femininity.', 'while girls recognize that magazine standards of feminine beauty are unrealistic experience tells them that the cultural mandate to be beautiful conveyed by these texts is real claims currie  p. .', 'in conclusion currie writes the power of the text lies in its demonstrated ability not only to construct a reading subject who accepts dominant definitions of being a woman but also to normalize the dominant order as it is experienced through school culture  p. .', 'magazines seek to document and reproduce the social world of adolescents this textual mirror may offer a truthful enough representation of teen life that the improving suggestions of the publication become normalized and not extreme.', 'that is the lived experiences of teenage girls are not directly informed via literal translations of magazine texts.', 'however the extranormalizing power of these teenzines is a real consequence of their reading.the relationship created between reader and magazine is fostered through text the naturalness with which the words can be read and the articles arguments understood pacifies the reader and may allow her to drift more willingly into the space created between publication and reader.', 'by understanding the cognitive development of adolescents magazine publishers and writers can take advantage of the appropriateness of certain texts and vocabularies.', 'according to piaget early adolescents at the formal operational level are just beginning to apply operations not only to objects but to hypotheses formulated in words  p. .', 'the teen magazine as developmental guide is rife with hypothetical identities under the guidance of the editors a reader may contemplate presumably through manipulation of fashion and makeup for example a number of personalities.', 'the illustrations of these potential selves are constructed and made more effective by utilizing specific and timely terminology.', 'for example while a teen magazine like ym or cosmogirl may not employ the most sophisticated vocabulary or metaphor the use of teenspecific slang makes the text nearly incomprehensible

of shame in modern societies are the body functions ones appearance and ones emotions p.  and that these sources of shame are relatively new.', 'elias shows how shame was being used to socialize

'within each collection scenarios related to teen social encounters rule breaking and physical control showcased teen and often gender specific landscapes as potential etiquette minefields.', 'the

adolescent girls.', 'clearly teenaged girls caught out of control making out with a partner showing off to attract attention applying makeup with a heavy or an uneducated hand risk embarrassment and social alienation.', 'the teenaged reader made aware of the risks of certain behaviors in certain scenarios can by studying these columns develop a literal vocabulary of humiliation while absorbing subtextual societal rules.the data included in the figures attached to this research are indicative of an initial and individual reading of the collected embarrassing stories.', 'verification of these findings occurred later and involved the rereading of the texts by the primary investigator and the reading and evaluation of the texts by a secondary reader.', 'in the reading process each reader was asked to code the embarrassing stories in terms of their aboutness and based on a list of subject headings created for this purpose.', 'the aboutness or the subject of each anecdote was to be considered the thing afforded matter or action of a specified kind a ground motive or cause from the oxford english dictionarys definition of subject.', 'that is though the general theme of all the narratives was embarrassment or embarrassing stories the subject selections reference the potential causes of the humiliations described.by tabulating the occurrences of agreement among readers of

a measurement of .', 'the findings here were only reliable at .. further examination of the data showed that the significanceaffecting disagreement between readers regarded distinguishing the differences between embarrassing events occurring as a result of general clumsiness or as a result of accidents occurring while the narrator was showing off.', 'a hypothetical merging of this data into a single category increased the measurement of kappa past the significant mark.', 'the lack of terminological clarity that seemed to have negatively affected the reliability measurement may be considered a methodological error stricter adherence to the codes of scientific content analysis in an iteration of this examination may allow for more reliable and conclusive statistical data.', 'additional numeric inconclusiveness may have been a result of the gender of the readers.', 'a comparison of the subject assignments of a body of male readers and a body of female readers may address the issue of the gendered nature of the texts and the meaning making implications of such a finding.within the narratives certain phrases were used with frequency to emphasize the dire nature of the embarrassing situation and to heighten the humiliation stakes.', 'according to these anecdotes often the embarrassing act is a secondary source of unease the audience of the act can determine the level of shame conveyed in the text.', 'any embarrassment witnessed by the entire school or entire grade performed before the most popular boy girl or clique or meant to impress the bestlooking or hottest teacher or boy was almost certain to rate higher on the humiliation scale than lowerstakes scenarios.', 'in these anecdotes embarrassment was not necessarily selfdetermined the level of shame was a product of the status of the watchers.', 'this observation is notable both on a discursive and societal level.', 'the drama of the setup for the embarrassing story is heightened by the description of the highstakes audience involved.', 'that the narrators social standing may be in the balance makes the experience of reading the tale all the more delicious.', 'additionally a reader may absorb the implication that she as a female as a character secondary to the popular clique or the bestlooking boy will consistently occupy the object position in both the reallife tale and in her own life.', 'the internalization of the concept of the self as secondary of womanhood as a performance may be a byproduct of these intentionally sympathetic stories.the embarrassing stories content in teen magazines utilize a specific vocabulary of foreshadowing frequent readers of these columns may become adept at interpreting the magazines unique code of prescience.', 'louise rosenblatt writes that a reader brings her own experiences to a text and that these experiences shape the reading of a work for an individual.', 'these experiences may include knowledge of another language situational experiences similar to the conflicts portrayed in the literature or exposure to specific cultural symbols and mores.', 'rosenblatt writes that the words on the page encourage the reader to draw on his past experiences with what the words point to in life and literature.', 'the text presents these words in a new and unique pattern.', 'out of these he is enabled actually to mold a new experience the literary work  p. .', 'in the case of adolescent magazines embarrassing stories a specific language of prediction is honed as readers accumulate experiences with a text.the acquisition of an embarrassing stories vocabulary becomes part of what rosenblatt would deem a literary experience the readers fluency in this vocabulary will inform her reading of the stories themselves.', 'for example often in the tales of menstrual mistakes the mention of a white dress worn by the protagonist hints at a forthcoming menstrual disaster.', 'that a ruined white or lightcolored dress or outfit becomes code for the ultimate menstrual mistake is of special note the evidence of womanhood itself as displayed in a clothing stain is an ironic and distinctly genderspecific source of embarrassment to portray in a teenage girls magazine.', 'that the merest hint of a girls menstrual period is the source of embarrassment is evidenced in the tales involving the accidental sighting of wrapped tampons or the purchase of feminine hygiene items.', 'additional harbingers of doom include the mention of special attention paid to appearancehair clothes and makeupin anticipation of a particular often romantic encounter these best laid plans can fail when a newly laundered outfit attracts a pair of staticy underpants a trendy pair of jeans gets wet and bleeds dye on the wearer or a tight pair of pants splits as the wearer bends over to attract a male.the cultivation of a specific vocabulary of suspense and foreshadowing that is granted meaning from the context in which it is situated is a phenomenon present here and described in readerresponse theory.', 'following rosenblatt we can hypothesize that the readers past experiences with reading similarly themed tales allow her to predict the scenario of humiliation explicated in each embarrassing text.', 'this predictability grants a certain power to the experienced reader that is unavailable to the stories narrators while the narrator of an embarrassing story fails to anticipate the humiliation to come the readerfluent in the language of the texthas likely foreseen the embarrassment described later.', 'this foresight is a predictive gift cultivated by the reader as she reads one that bestows on her a certain prescient textual power.', 'the reallife application of this reading is less agential with the literal narrative absent in her living world the teen reader learns to edit her own movements in anticipation and avoidance of the outcomes described in the embarrassing stories.although the embarrassing stories can be categorized by subject or anecdote see table  a less granular approach to analysis reveals three primary themes discussed throughout the columns behavior with boys body function and intimate exposure.', 'behavior with boys is discussed and analyzed at length in these columns heterosexual relations are characterized as fraught with potential hazards.', 'embarrassing anecdotes of amorous errors include in an issue of seventeen a tale of a weldedtogether pair whose braces and lip jewelry linked together nearly inextricably.', 'getting caught in a clinch by parents brothers and sisters or teachers is the source of much humiliation as is showing too much interest in a member of the opposite sex.', 'stories dealing with the functions of the body centered mainly around menstrual period disasters with ym devoting an entire months column to menstrual stories.', 'stories falling under the intimate exposure category include both accidental nudity and the exposure of or mention of a narrators underwear.', 'the mere mention of or glimpse of the underwear proved embarrassing even if the underwear was unworn that is viewed in a drawer or backpack.', 'these three general categories can be easily mapped onto eliass per scheff primary sources of shame the body functions mapped to body functions ones appearance mapped to intimate exposure and ones emotions mapped to amorous errors.', 'while scheff and elias may argue that their thematic categories are universal as the categories are recalled in the pages of adolescent girls magazines their treatment becomes distinctly gendered.', 'see tables  and .tableembarrassing incidentsembarrassing actoccurrences ymoccurrences seventeenoccurrences teennnnshowing too much interest in a boy...amorous errors..accidental nudity

feminine success is measured by the avoidance of humiliations as great as those published the social lessons taught in the magazines columns involve decreasing participation in events that could lead to the outcomes depicted.', 'a certain social paranoia may emerge in the reader who absorbs the identity of the watchful woman who must be ever vigilant guarding her intimate apparel from view avoiding revealing clothing and maintaining the secrecy surrounding menstruation or any bodily function.', 'luise eichenbaum and susie orbach identified these ideas of selfdenial and feminine presentation in their  book understanding women a feminist psychoanalytic approach.', 'according to eichenbaum and orbach the exhibition of the edited self is learned in childhood observation the little girl absorbs the idea that to get love and approval she must show a particular side of herself.', 'she must hide her emotional cravings her disappointments and her angers.', 'she must hide her self.', 'she comes to feel that there must be something wrong with who she really is which in turn must mean there is something wrong with what she needs and what she wants  p. .the teen magazine may further this concept with its embarrassing stories based on their exploitation of social donts the female reader may learn to associate some of her natural inclinations menstruation sexuality with inappropriateness.', 'the irreverent and genuinely humorous content of these columns of embarrassing stories attracts readers while the use of developmentally appropriate language and topical subject matter furthers an agenda of social control.the eventual outcome of the internalization of these rules may already have been predicted by eichenbaum and orbach slowly the girl develops an acceptable self one that appears selfsufficient and capable and will receive more consistent acceptance  p. .', 'taylor l. a teen writing of a regifting humiliation for teens embarrassing stories page illustrates the discomfort resulting from the false fronting i pretended to laugh with the other students laughing at me but deep down i felt like barfing.although teen magazines may be seen as gross influences on girls identity development it is important to theorize the effects of the discourse and to examine how readers of these magazines navigate the text.', 'readerresponse theorist arthur applebee links readers responses to text to development mainly following piagets theorized stages of development.', 'during adolescence the resources of formal operations have a dramatic effect on the childs response to literature theorizes applebee  p. .', 'as readers mature their ability to relate to and draw conclusions from a text increases in scope and complexity.', 'applebee claims that as readers enter the initial stages of formal operations their ability to analyze a text in terms of their own experiences is developed.', 'this onetoone relationship between reader experience and text is complicated as the reader reaches the later stage of formal operations and begins to see the text as one of many statements of how life might be understood rather than simply a presentation of life as it is  p. .', 'the initial period of text relation begins around age  or coincidentally in the continuum of most teen magazines target marketsand grows in analytic complexity around age .', 'here we may see the window of time marked by personal relation to textpiagets initial stage of formal operations and applebees early stage of analytic abilitya unique period of vulnerability to developmental influence through text.developmentalists psychologists and even readerresponse theorists characterize the period of adolescence as a period of shifting paradigms.', 'erikson writes of the painful selfawareness of the teen years and the struggle to attach to a frame of reference outside the self on which to build identity.', 'piaget associates adolescence with the increasing ability to perform complex tasks while applebee applies this cognitive growth to literacy and the experience of reading.', 'teen magazines constructed with this convoluted time of physical and cognitive development in mind do answer the needs of adolescent readers.', 'by providing a framework for identity growth supplying images of societal perfection and taking advantage of the onetoone relationship that can be forged between reader and text magazines for teenagers as well as those for adults effectively guide identity development.', 'the narrowness of this identity framework as well as the normalcy promised if the guidelines described in the magazines are followed is a source of critique identified by driscoll through a cult of normality and an eroticisation of the adolescent womans concern with normalizing her body the feminine adolescent body is constructed in girls magazines as a range of desires trespassed upon by a variety of physiological imperfections  p. .', 'clearly driscoll and others acknowledge the successfulness of these publications in defining the parameters of identity and encouraging the marketing of these identities to teenaged readers.', 'the effectiveness of these magazines to shape the identities of readers is rarely called into question on the contrary it is the shape of the identities the publications advocate that is more often argued.after reading earnest letters from the editors of teen magazines to the thousands of readers who purchase the publication each month it becomes difficult to situate the friendly and helpful intent of the magazine staff within a greater context of capitalism and accusations of exploitation.', 'joy leman reminds us that the incantations of false intimacy are foregroundeda discourse of friendliness reassuring and relocating women in an idea of oppression and a position of exploitation are present in every issue  p. .', 'indeed according to leman the developmental needs of girls can be manipulated to serve the status quo and to maintain the profit motivations that sustain girls monthlies.', 'in a power relationship mirroring capitalism the teen magazine creates its own audience and thus its own sustenance.', 'as ideals are marketed and branded within the glossy pages advertisers pay to incorporate themselves within the identity for sale.', 'according to ross ballaster and colleagues the use of a feminine discourse the manipulation and creation of gendered needs answered by advertised products and the construction of the female reader as consumer is intrinsic to the survival of the magazines and the market that supports them.', 'defining women as not men  is evidently not a sufficient one for the womens magazine reports ballaster in a  analysis of womens publications.', 'if women are to buy and to be they cannot be defined solely in the negative femininity has to be given a particular content  p. .', 'here femininity is advertised as a shifting product an identity dependent on the consumption of goods or the application of products.', 'more important this advertising is displayed in a uniquely feminine space erikson where as ballaster writes women are more than just not men.because of the developmental appropriateness of teen magazines their influence on identity development has the potential to be great.', 'however opponents of the magazine argue that the identities illustrated between the pagesgirlfriend model student woman sexual beingare often considered insignificant weak or even degrading.', 'this weakness is an illusion founded on a history marked by the limited documentation of the participation of women in socalled relevant historical activity.', 'the identity historically accepted by womenincluding the feminine virtues of passive goodness personal service to others and devotion to the domestic sphere  p. has been limited not just by a conspiracy of patriarchy but by every woman who blindly accepts the supposed weakness associated with this identity.', 'by escaping the idea of the female as notmale and associating femaleness with pleasure and attractiveness  p.  as young girls did in an iteration of eriksons study a uniquely feminine power may be cultivated.', 'furthermore perhaps the perception of weakness or insignificant success lies in the frame we draw around womens accomplishments and identities.', 'the female space women create and celebrate is markedly different from the male power symbol and cannot be evaluated in the same way.', 'recognizing the strength in both models of power and identity may be the first step toward a goal of parity and a loosening of societal restraints binding womens identities.while some teen magazines may be dismissed as fluff by teachers and librarians researchers examining the practice of literacy remark on the agency associated with reading popular texts.', 'meredith cherland in an examination of girls reading practices in a canadian elementary and junior high school encourages us to view the popular reading of teenage girls outside of school assignments as recursive.', 'cherland drawing from giroux writes that girls popular reading goes against the hidden curriculum present in many schools that would equate the male experience  with human experience.', 'literature assigned in the school cherland observed  served on the one hand to validate only mans experience of the world and on the other hand to position female people as outsiders  p. .', 'the girls cherland observed turned to what some many consider gendered readings including the babysitters club and sweet valley high series to supplement the literature offered in school.', 'this practice turn toward the reading of scholastically antithetical texts is labeled the literate underlife by finders .', 'finders writes of the agency of girls who read against the masculine grain of assigned fiction and who practice literacy in subversive ways by writing graffiti passing and reading notes and reading adolescent magazines and popular fiction literate underlife created opportunities to disrupt the official to document a refusal to embrace the obligations of the institution  p. .', 'thus the action of reading in opposition to teacherprescribed norms becomes in the eyes of cherland and finders an act of rebellion.while the act of subversive reading may be a revolutionary one theorists note that female readers actively negotiate the content of what some consider to be repressive and gendered texts as well.', 'in sherrie innesss collection of essays delinquents and debutantes twentieth century american girls cultures a number of the writers note the tendency of readers to develop strategies for reading popular texts.', 'angela hubler writing of girls reading practices notes girl readers commonly focused on aspects of texts that confirmed female behavior they found desirable while ignoring or forgetting aspects that undermined these behaviors and she concludes it is clear that girls are not blank slates that unthinkingly reproduce the ideological messages written upon them  p. .', 'cherland echoes this observation writing the thoughts and emotions of the individual girlstheir sense of themselves and their ways of understanding their relation to the world are constituted as a dynamic process.', 'each girl reader also creates and practices individual forms of resistance to these broad cultural forms  p. .', 'there is a certain dynamism that occurs when girls read literature and texts created just for them clearly adolescent girl readers are engaged in a dialogue with the text not unlike the transaction suggested by rosenblatt.', 'while experience with a certain genre or texttype has the potential to inform the future reading of similarly themed materials the ultimate product of girls reading is the result of a number of textual and extratextual influences e.g.', 'cherlands thoughts and emotions of  individual girls.the practitioners dilemma in selecting these magazines for a school or public library collection arises as she weighs the consequences of supporting what lehman and others deem the capitalist patriarchy that supports the publications themselves against the potential benefits associated with encouraging a literate underlife.', 'if as cherland maintains the public school curriculum confers male privilege via the assignment of masculine texts the inclusion of feminized textslike the teen magazinesin a school librarys collection might serve to bring female readers to voice.', 'operating under the assumption that girl readers are not passive consumers we might discover that the girls reactions to and negotiations with these popular texts hone their critical literacy.', 'moreover the greater availability of these magazines in schools and public libraries may foil the capitalist mechanism that supports their existence as fewer girls purchase in book and drug stores what they might read gratis during lunch period with a group of friends in the library.teen magazines are powerful purveyors of image and identity.', 'a cover spot on a hot teen magazine may guarantee a rising star success as well as boost sales of the publication.', 'it is the inherent power relationshipbetween the teenage feminine interest identity development popular culture relationship navigation and the interests of the advertising agencies that influence magazine contentthat is at the crux of the controversy surrounding the influence of teen magazines on their readers.', 'the tone of intimacy and the creation of a feminine space between the pages of the publications mirror a selfawareness intrinsic in adolescent development.', 'to begin reading a girls teen magazine is to enter a world of selfinterest a uniquely feminine world concerned with not only appearance but also bodily function and interpersonal relationships.', 'ironically or perhaps appropriately it is the towering influence of the capital driving the publication of such magazines that sours the experience.', 'the inner space created within the magazine is tainted by the pervasive advertising content the princess is despoiled but by the grace of the grounded reader maintains hope for rebirth.']\n"
